==================

You can have multiple addresses with your profile. You can post
to your groups from any address, but you only need to receive
email on some of them. This is quite useful if you have a
work-email (or several) as well as a home email address.

*Manage* your email addresses using your email settings page:
<tal:block content="view/changeEmailUrl">URL</tal:block>
<tal:block condition="python:len(view.preferred)==1">
* Your preferred address</tal:block><tal:block condition="python:len(view.preferred)&gt;1">* Your preferred addresses</tal:block>
<tal:block repeat="address view/preferred">  + <tal:block content="address">person@example.com</tal:block></tal:block>
<tal:block condition="python:len(view.verified)==1">
* Your other address</tal:block><tal:block condition="python:len(view.verified)&gt;1">* Your other addresses</tal:block>
<tal:block repeat="address view/verified">  + <tal:block content="address">person@example.com</tal:block></tal:block>

<tal:block condition="view/unverified"><tal:block condition="python:len(view.unverified)==1">Unverified address

</tal:block><tal:block condition="python:len(view.unverified)&gt;1">Unverified addresses
--------------------</tal:block>
  You must *verify* that you control each address before you can
  use it to post, or receive email. Visit your email settings to
  *resend* the verification message to activate the address.
